<poem title="Ozymandias">
    <Sentence n="1">
        
    <line n="1">I met a traveller from an antique land,</line>
    <line n="2">Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone </line>
    <line n="3">Stand in the desert. <ellipsis/> Near them, on the sand,</line>
    <line n="4">Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</line>
    <line n="5">And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,</line>
    <line n="6">Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</line>
    <line n="7">Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,</line>
    <line n="8">The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;</line>
    <line n="9">And on the pedestal, these words appear:</line>
    <line n="10">My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;</line>
    <line n="11">Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!</line>
    <line n="12">Nothing beside remains. Round the decay</line>
    <line n="13">Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare</line>
    <line n="14">The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</line>
    </Sentence>
